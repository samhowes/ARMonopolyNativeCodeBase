Notes:
 - By adding the unity subview to ARMViewController in ARMAppController:createViewHierarchyImpl, I don't have to have Test/ARMViewcontroller classes, and can just have one production class.

Tasks:
 R Test Bluetooth
 R Copy files from bundle folder to documents at launch

 F Do the artwork for the App Icon and loading screens
 F Splash screen
 F Re-launch screen
 F Add user hints about finding a game tile
